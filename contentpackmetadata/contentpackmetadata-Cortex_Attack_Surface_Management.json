	"readme": "The **Cortex Attack Surface Management** pack is supported by Cortex Xpanse Expander and the (Attack Surface Management) ASM module for Cortex XSIAM.\n\n[Cortex Xpanse](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xpanse) Expander and the Attack Surface Management (ASM) module for [Cortex XSIAM](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xsiam) are both best in class External Attack Surface Management solutions that strive to proactively reduce the frequency and severity of security incidents caused by internet-exposed risks. These solutions deliver comprehensive attack surface visibility by combining thorough, ML-enhanced asset attribution with continuous attack surface assessment. Any discovered risks are prioritized using contextual information and exploitability data, and findings are actioned through curated, automated playbooks to investigate, remediate, and summarize every new alert.\n\n## What does this pack do?\n\nThis pack contains all of the integrations, automations, and playbooks necessary to fully automate the investigation, remediation, verification, and reporting on ASM risks within Cortex Xpanse Expander and Cortex XSIAM. Currently our pack:\n\n- Enriches services, assets, and alerts based on out-of-the-box integrations with sources like CMDBs, Cloud Service Providers, VM solutions, and more.\n- Uses ML assisted analysis to identify critical context useful for analyst decision making.\n- Keeps human analysts in the loop to direct the desired remediation action depending on the type of risk and discovered context.\n- Includes automated notification and ticket creation workflows for delegating remediation tasks to the appropriate service owners.\n- Includes full automated remediation options for automatically removing risky services from the public internet.\n- Sends out a notification to identified service owners via email about the remediation action taken.\n- Supports validation re-scanning to ensure that remediation efforts have been applied successfully.\n- Includes PDF reporting capabilities for preserving and communicating the investigation summary.\n\n## How to use it?\n\nThe Active Response playbook contains a set of sub-playbooks, which support many different remediation paths that can be taken depending on the types of configured integrations, the type of alert, and input provided by the analyst.\n\nFor setting up the Active Response module for Xpanse, [a guide on how to configure the Active Response module can we found here.](https://docs-cortex.paloaltonetworks.com/r/Cortex-XPANSE/Cortex-Xpanse-Expander-User-Guide/Set-Up-Active-Response)\n\nAditionally, [a list of integrations used for the Active Response playbook can be found here](https://docs-cortex.paloaltonetworks.com/r/Cortex-XPANSE/Cortex-Xpanse-Expander-User-Guide/Automated-Remediation-Capabilities-Matrix?section=UUID-0a5dcbc2-d5ab-fa4e-5efc-599daac8b39b_table-idm4546555537995233526554598204). These are needed for different enrichment and remediation possibilities.\n\n### Demo Video\n\n[![Active Response in Cortex Xpanse](api/marketplace/file?name=content/packs/CortexAttackSurfaceManagement/readme_images/hq720.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rryAQ23uuqw \"Active Response in Cortex Xpanse\")\n\n### Automated Remediation Requirements\n\nAutomated remediation is only possible when the right conditions are met.  These are the current requirements:\n\n- One of the following attack surface rule IDs:\n  - Insecure OpenSSH\n  - OpenSSH\n  - SSH Server\n  - SNMP Server\n  - RDP Server\n  - Telnet Server\n  - Unencrypted FTP Server\n  - Mysql Server\n  - Mongo Server\n  - Postgres Server\n  - Elasticsearch Server\n  - Unclaimed S3 Bucket*\n- Asset is a cloud compute instance:\n  - AWS EC2 Instance\n  - Azure Compute Instance\n  - GCP Compute Engine (VM)\n- Service owner information found through one of the following:\n  - AWS IAM\n  - Azure IAM\n  - GCP IAM\n  - Prisma Cloud\n  - Rapid7 InsightVM (Nexpose)\n  - Splunk\n  - ServiceNow CMDB\n  - Tenable.io Assets\n  - Qualys\n- Indicators of a non-production host:\n  - \"dev\" or related words found in environment-related tags associated with the asset (case insensitive)\n  - Has an active \"DevelopmentEnvironment\" classification from processing of public data\n\n\\* The `Unclaimed S3 Bucket` attack surface rule ID only requires `AWS-S3` integration to be enabled.\n\n## What is included in this pack?\n\nThe main active response playbook is the `Cortex ASM - ASM Alert` playbook. This playbook contains a set of sub-playbooks and automation scripts, which support many different remediation paths that can be taken depending on the types of configured integrations, the type of alert, and input provided by the analyst. After the final stage, the alert is resolved.\n\n- Playbooks\n  - [Cortex ASM - ASM Alert](#cortex-asm---asm-alert)\n  - [Cortex ASM - AWS Enrichment](#cortex-asm---aws-enrichment)\n  - [Cortex ASM -

Development servers have no external users and run no production workflows. These servers might be named \"dev\", but they might also be named \"qa\", \"pre-production\", \"user acceptance testing\", or use other non-production terms. This automation uses both public data visible to anyone (`active_classifications` as derived by Xpanse ASM) as well as checking internal data for AI-learned indicators of development systems (`asm_tags` as derived from integrations with non-public systems).\n\n![InferWhetherServiceIsDev](api/marketplace/file?name=content/packs/CortexAttackSurfaceManagement/readme_images/InferWhetherServiceIsDev.png)\n\n#### RankServiceOwners\n\nAn automation that recommends the most likely service owners from those surfaced by Cortex ASM Enrichment and updates content.\n\n#### GetProjectOwners\n\nThis automation parses a GCP service account email for the project ID, then looks up the project owners and adds them to a list of potential service owners for ranking.\n\n#### RemediationPathRuleEvaluation\n\nAn automation that is used to find a matching remediation path rule based on criteria.  If multiple rules match, it will return the most recently created rule.  This assumes that the rules passed in are filtered to correlate with the alert's attack surface rule (Xpanse only).\n\n![RemediationPathRuleEvaluation](api/marketplace/file?name=content/packs/CortexAttackSurfaceManagement/readme_images/RemediationPathRuleEvaluation.png)\n",
